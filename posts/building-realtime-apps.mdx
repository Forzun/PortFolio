# Building Real-Time Apps with Socket.io and React

## Introduction

Real-time features like chat, notifications, and live updates are essential for modern web apps. Socket.io makes it easy to add real-time communication to your React projects.

## What is Socket.io?

Socket.io is a library for real-time, bidirectional communication between web clients and servers.

## Setting Up

1. Install Socket.io on both server and client:

```bash
npm install socket.io socket.io-client
```

2. Set up a basic server:

```js
const io = require("socket.io")(3000);
io.on("connection", (socket) => {
  console.log("User connected");
  socket.on("message", (msg) => io.emit("message", msg));
});
```

3. Connect from React:

```js
import { useEffect } from "react";
import io from "socket.io-client";
const socket = io("http://localhost:3000");

useEffect(() => {
  socket.on("message", (msg) => {
    // handle message
  });
}, []);
```

## Use Cases

- Chat apps
- Live dashboards
- Collaborative tools

## Conclusion

Socket.io and React make it straightforward to build engaging, real-time experiences for your users.
