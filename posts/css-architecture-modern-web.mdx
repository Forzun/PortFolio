# CSS Architecture for the Modern Web

## Introduction

As web apps grow, managing CSS becomes challenging. Good CSS architecture keeps your styles scalable and maintainable.

## Methodologies

- **BEM (Block Element Modifier):** Naming convention for classes.
- **SMACSS:** Categorizes CSS rules for better organization.
- **Utility-First (Tailwind CSS):** Use small, reusable classes for rapid development.

## Best Practices

- Use a consistent naming convention
- Avoid global styles when possible
- Modularize your CSS (CSS Modules, Styled Components)

## Tooling

- PostCSS for processing
- CSS-in-JS for scoped styles

## Conclusion

Investing in CSS architecture pays off as your project scales. Choose a methodology that fits your team and project needs.
