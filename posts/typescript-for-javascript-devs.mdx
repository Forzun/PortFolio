# TypeScript for JavaScript Developers: A Practical Guide

## Introduction

TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds static typing, making your code more robust and maintainable. If you're a JavaScript developer, learning TypeScript can greatly improve your workflow.

## Why TypeScript?

- Catches errors at compile time
- Improves code readability and refactoring
- Great tooling and editor support

## Getting Started

Install TypeScript:

```bash
npm install -D typescript
```

Add a `tsconfig.json` to configure your project.

## Key Concepts

- **Types**: Annotate variables, function parameters, and return values.
- **Interfaces**: Define object shapes.
- **Generics**: Write reusable, type-safe code.

## Example

```ts
function greet(name: string): string {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}
```

## Migrating from JS to TS

- Rename `.js` files to `.ts` or `.tsx`
- Fix type errors incrementally

## Conclusion

TypeScript is a valuable skill for any modern web developer. Start small, and you'll quickly see the benefits.
