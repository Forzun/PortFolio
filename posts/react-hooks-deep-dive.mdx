# React Hooks Deep Dive: Beyond useState and useEffect

## Introduction

React Hooks revolutionized how we write React components, making it easier to manage state, side effects, and more. While `useState` and `useEffect` are the most commonly used hooks, React provides several other powerful hooks, and you can even create your own custom hooks to encapsulate logic and reuse it across components.

## Advanced Built-in Hooks

### useContext

Share data easily across your component tree without prop drilling.

### useReducer

Manage complex state logic in a predictable way, similar to Redux but built-in.

### useMemo & useCallback

Optimize performance by memoizing expensive calculations and functions.

## Custom Hooks

Custom hooks let you extract component logic into reusable functions. For example:

```tsx
import { useState, useEffect } from "react";

function useWindowWidth() {
  const [width, setWidth] = useState(window.innerWidth);
  useEffect(() => {
    const handleResize = () => setWidth(window.innerWidth);
    window.addEventListener("resize", handleResize);
    return () => window.removeEventListener("resize", handleResize);
  }, []);
  return width;
}
```

## Patterns and Best Practices

- Prefix custom hooks with `use`.
- Keep hooks pure and focused.
- Share logic, not state.

## Conclusion

Mastering hooks unlocks the full power of React. Explore the docs, experiment, and build your own custom hooks to supercharge your apps.
